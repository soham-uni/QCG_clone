      <p>Quantum Computing Group is a student-run group to inculcate and uplift the culture of quantum computing at IIT Roorkee. Founded in 2020, QCG is currently a part of ACM IIT Roorkee Student Chapter. Our members have varied interests and skills in different domains of quantum computing and attempt to elevate the technological standing of the campus populace in those specialisations. We do so by organising concept discussions, hands-on workshops, open projects and an annual quantum computing hackathon that gives the students exposure to the advancements in the quantum computing sphere.</p>
